                <h2>🕯️ Warning: Don't Memorize Patterns</h2>
                <p>Most beginners memorize "Hammer," "Doji," "Harami." This is useless if you don't understand
                    <strong>WHY</strong> the candle formed.</p>
                <div class="mentor-secret">
                    <h3>💡 The Mentor's Secret</h3>
                    <p>"A candlestick is not a shape. It is a war story between Buyers (Bulls) and Sellers (Bears) over
                        a specific time period. Your job is not to name the candle, but to see who won the war."</p>

                <h2>🔎 Anatomy of the War (OHLC)</h2>
                <p>Every candle tells you four things:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Open:</strong> Who was in control when the bell rang?</li>
                    <li><strong>High:</strong> How far did the Bulls push?</li>
                    <li><strong>Low:</strong> How far did the Bears push?</li>
                    <li><strong>Close:</strong> Who had the final say? (The most important price).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The Wick (Tail):</strong> A long wick represents <strong>Rejection</strong>. If you see a
                    long wick at the bottom, it means Bears tried to push it down, but Bulls pushed them back. That is
                    hidden buying pressure.</p>

                <h2>🔥 The 3 Power Candles You MUST Know</h2>
                <p>Forget the 50 exotic patterns. In intraday trading, these 3 tell you 90% of the story.</p>

                        <h4>1. The Power Candle (Marubozu/Elephant)</h4>
                        <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Big body, tiny or no wicks.<br>
                            <strong>Story:</strong> Complete dominance. If Green, buyers are aggressive. If Red, sellers
                            are panicking.<br>
                            <strong>Action:</strong> Don't trade against this candle. The trend is strong.

                        <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Tiny body, long wicks on both sides.<br>
                            <strong>Story:</strong> War is tied. Buyers and sellers are equally matched. Confusion.<br>
                            <strong>Action:</strong> Wait. A big move is usually coming next. Do not enter inside a
                            Doji.

                        <h4>3. The Rejection Candle (Hammer/Pinbar)</h4>
                        <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Small body on one end, very long tail on the other.<br>
                            <strong>Story:</strong> A trap. One side tried to push price, but got brutally rejected.<br>
                            <strong>Action:</strong> A clear reversal signal. If found at Support (Hammer) or Resistance
                            (Shooting Star), it is a high-probability trade.

                <h2>📍 Context is King</h2>
                <p>A "Hammer" candle in the middle of nowhere means NOTHING. <strong>Location is 50% of the

                <h2>✅ Today's Action Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open <strong>Bank Nifty</strong> on a 15-minute chart.</li>
                    <li>Find the biggest Green Candle of the day. Did the price continue going up after that? (Power
                        Candle logic).</li>
                    <li>Find a candle with a huge wick. Did the price reverse from there? (Rejection logic).</li>
                    <li>Don't trade yet. Just observe the war.</li>
