                <h2>📈 Profitability Ratios: How Well Does It Grow?</h2>
                <p>Profitability ratios measure how efficiently a company uses its resources to generate profit. For long-term investors, sustainability is key.</p>

                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>💡 Return on Equity (ROE)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Net Income / Shareholder's Equity</p>
                    <p>ROE tells you how much profit the company generates for every dollar of shareholder equity. A high ROE (generally >15-20%) indicates a business that is effectively compounding its own capital.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>💡 Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Formula:</strong> EBIT / (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</p>
                    <p>ROCE is often considered superior to ROE because it includes debt in the calculation. It tells you how well the company uses <i>all</i> its capital (both equity and debt) to generate earnings. Look for ROCE that is consistently higher than the company's cost of borrowing.</p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>🔍 Operating Efficiency: The Margins</h2>
                <p>Margins tell you how much of every sales dollar actually makes it to the bottom line.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Operating Margin:</strong> (Operating Income / Revenue). This shows how well the core business is running before taxes and interest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Net Margin:</strong> (Net Income / Revenue). The final percentage of profit.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="box-gold">
                    <h4>🌟 The Trend is Your Friend</h4>
                    <p>Individual numbers are less important than the <strong>trend</strong>. Is the operating margin expanding over the last 5 years? That's a sign of a strengthening competitive advantage or better efficiency.</p>
                </div>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>🛡️ Financial Health & Solvency</h2>
                <p>A company can be profitable but still "fragile" if it has too much debt. We use health ratios to ensure the company won't go bust during a recession.</p>

                <h3>1. Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio</h3>
                <p>Shows the proportion of equity and debt used to finance assets. Ideally, for conservative long-term investing, you want a D/E ratio under 1.0, though this varies by industry (utilities have higher debt, tech has lower).</p>

                <h3>2. Current Ratio (Liquidity)</h3>
                <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Current Assets / Current Liabilities</p>
                <p>Can the company pay its short-term bills? A ratio above 1.5 is generally comfortable. Anything below 1.0 is a red flag—the company might need to raise cash or take on expensive debt soon.</p>

                <h2>✅ Today's Action Steps</h2>
                <div class="action-step">
                    <h4>📝 Action Step 1: Ratio Comparison (20 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Pick the company you looked at yesterday (e.g., Apple or Microsoft) and find a direct competitor (e.g., Samsung for Apple, Google for Microsoft).</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Find the <strong>ROE</strong> for both companies. Which one is higher?</li>
                        <li>Find the <strong>Debt-to-Equity</strong> ratio. Which company is "safer"?</li>
                        <li>Why do you think one is outperforming the other based on these two numbers?</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <div class="action-step">
                    <h4>📝 Action Step 2: Spot the Red Flag (10 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Look at a struggling retail or airline company. Check their <strong>Current Ratio</strong>. Is it below 1.0? Look at their Debt-to-Equity over the last 3 years. Is it rising?</p>
