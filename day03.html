                <blockquote>
                    "If I could only teach one concept to a new trader, it would be support and resistance. Master this, and you're 80% of the way there."
                    <cite>— Professional Floor Trader</cite>
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>Support and resistance levels are <strong>price areas where buying or selling pressure is expected to be strong enough to pause or reverse price movement</strong>. They represent the collective memory of the market.</p>
                
                <h3>Support: Where Buyers Step In</h3>
                <p><strong>Support</strong> is a price level where demand is strong enough to prevent price from falling further. Think of it as a floor.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Buyers believe the price is "cheap" and start buying</li>
                    <li>Sellers who shorted want to take profits</li>
                    <li>Previous buyers who missed out see a second chance</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Resistance: Where Sellers Step In</h3>
                <p><strong>Resistance</strong> is a price level where supply is strong enough to prevent price from rising further. Think of it as a ceiling.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sellers believe the price is "expensive" and start selling</li>
                    <li>Buyers who bought lower want to take profits</li>
                    <li>People who bought at that level and saw losses want to "get out even"</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>💡 The Psychology Behind S/R</h4>
                    <p>Support and resistance work because <strong>humans have memory</strong>. If a stock bounced at $50 three times in the past, traders remember. When it approaches $50 again, buyers anticipate another bounce and buy—creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. The more times a level is tested, the more significant it becomes.</p>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>🔍 3 Methods to Identify S/R Levels</h2>
                
                <h3>Method 1: Swing Highs and Swing Lows</h3>
                <p>The most basic and reliable method. Look for points where price reversed direction.</p>
                
                <div class="chart-example">
        ←── Swing High (Resistance)
       /\
      /  \          ←── Swing High (Resistance)
     /    \        /\
    /      \      /  \
   /        \    /    \
              \  /      
               \/
               ↑
         Swing Low (Support)
                </div>
                
                <p><strong>Rule:</strong> A swing high requires at least 2 lower candles on each side. A swing low requires at least 2 higher candles on each side.</p>
                
                <h3>Method 2: Round Numbers (Psychological Levels)</h3>
                <p>Humans are drawn to round numbers. $100, $50, $25, $10 are all psychological levels that act as S/R.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Major levels:</strong> $50, $100, $150, $200...</li>
                    <li><strong>Medium levels:</strong> $25, $75, $125...</li>
                    <li><strong>Minor levels:</strong> $10, $20, $30...</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Method 3: Volume Clusters</h3>
                <p>Areas where a lot of trading occurred in the past become significant S/R zones. Many platforms show "Volume Profile" which highlights these areas.</p>
                
                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>💡 Quality Over Quantity</h4>
                    <p>Don't draw 50 lines on your chart. Focus on the <strong>most significant</strong> 3-5 levels. A good support/resistance level should be:
                    <br>• Touched multiple times (2+ touches minimum)
                    <br>• Visible on higher timeframes
                    <br>• Confluent with other factors (round numbers, moving averages)</p>

                <h2>🔄 Role Reversal: The Magic of Flip Zones</h2>
                
                <p>One of the most powerful concepts in technical analysis: <strong>Old resistance becomes new support, and old support becomes new resistance.</strong></p>
                
                <div class="chart-example">
                                    ↗ Price continues up
                                   /
                                  /
RESISTANCE ────────────────────/────── Now becomes SUPPORT
               \    /\    /   ↑
                \  /  \  /   Price breaks above
                 \/    \/    then pulls back and bounces
                </div>
                
                <h3>Why Does This Happen?</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Trapped traders:</strong> People who sold at resistance are now underwater and looking to get out at breakeven</li>
                    <li><strong>Missed opportunity:</strong> Traders who missed the breakout see the pullback as a second chance to buy</li>
                    <li><strong>New floor established:</strong> The breakout proves buyers are stronger, establishing a new floor</li>
                </ol>
                
                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>💡 The Retest Trade</h4>
                    <p>One of the highest probability setups: Wait for price to break through a level, then <strong>wait for the retest</strong> of that level before entering. This gives you:
                    <br>• Confirmation the breakout is real
                    <br>• Better entry price
                    <br>• Clearer stop-loss placement</p>

                <h2>📊 Bounces vs. Breakouts: When to Trade What</h2>
                
                <h3>Trading the Bounce (Range Trading)</h3>
                <p>When price is in a range, trade the bounces:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Buy when price touches support and shows rejection</li>
                    <li>Sell when price touches resistance and shows rejection</li>
                    <li>Use the opposite level as your target</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Trading the Breakout</h3>
                <p>When price breaks through a level convincingly:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enter in the direction of the breakout</li>
                    <li>Or wait for the retest (safer)</li>
                    <li>Use the breakout level as your new S/R reference</li>

                    <h4>⚠️ Beware of False Breakouts</h4>
                    <p>Not every breakout is real. Many fail and reverse. Signs of a false breakout:</p>
                    <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                        <li>Low volume on the breakout candle</li>
                        <li>Quick reversal back below/above the level</li>
                        <li>Breakout against the larger trend</li>
                        <li>Long wicks (rejection candles)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Solution:</strong> Wait for the candle to CLOSE beyond the level, or wait for a retest.</p>
