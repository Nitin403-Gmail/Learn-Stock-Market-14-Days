            <!-- What is the Stock Market -->
            <section class="section">
                <h2>📈 What Is The Stock Market, Really?</h2>

                <p>Forget the complicated explanations. At its core, the stock market is simply a <strong>marketplace
                        where people buy and sell ownership pieces (shares) of companies</strong>.</p>

                <h3>The Simple Truth</h3>
                <p>When you buy a stock, you're buying a tiny piece of that company. If the company does well and grows,
                    your piece becomes more valuable. If it struggles, your piece loses value.</p>

                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>💡 Key Insight</h4>
                    <p>Stock prices move for one reason only: <strong>supply and demand</strong>. If more people want to
                        buy than sell, prices go up. If more people want to sell than buy, prices go down. Everything
                        else—earnings reports, news, technical patterns—only matters because they influence buying and
                        selling decisions.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Main Players</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Retail Traders (You)</strong> - Individual investors trading their own money</li>
                    <li><strong>Institutional Investors</strong> - Big funds, banks, pension funds with massive capital
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Market Makers</strong> - Firms that provide liquidity by always offering to buy and sell
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Exchanges</strong> - NYSE, NASDAQ - the venues where trades happen</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How Trades Actually Happen</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>You place an order to buy 10 shares of Apple at $175</li>
                    <li>Your broker sends this order to an exchange or market maker</li>
                    <li>The system matches your buy order with someone willing to sell at $175</li>
                    <li>The trade executes, and you now own those shares</li>
                </ol>

                <p>This happens in milliseconds. The complexity behind the scenes doesn't change what you need to focus
                    on: <strong>buying low and selling high</strong>.</p>

            <!-- The 80/20 Principle -->
            <section class="section">
                <h2>🧠 The 80/20 Principle in Trading</h2>

                <blockquote>
                    "The majority of profits come from a minority of trades. The majority of losses come from fighting
                    this truth."
                    <cite>— Trading Wisdom</cite>
                </blockquote>

                <p>The Pareto Principle states that roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. In trading, this
                    manifests in several critical ways:</p>

                <h3>How 80/20 Applies to Your Trading</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>20% of your trades</strong> will generate 80% of your profits</li>
                    <li><strong>20% of trading concepts</strong> will create 80% of your edge</li>
                    <li><strong>20% of stocks</strong> will provide 80% of your opportunities</li>
                    <li><strong>20% of your time</strong> should be trading; 80% should be waiting</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>💡 The Mentor's Secret</h4>
                    <p>After coaching over 1,000 traders, I've found that <strong>most people fail because they try to
                            learn everything</strong>. They watch 100 YouTube videos, study 50 indicators, and memorize
                        30 candlestick patterns—then can't execute a single profitable trade consistently. The winners?
                        They master 5-7 core concepts and apply them relentlessly.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The 7 High-Impact Concepts We'll Master</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Price Action & Market Structure</strong> - How to read what the market is telling you
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Support & Resistance</strong> - Where to buy, where to sell</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk Management</strong> - How to not lose your money</li>
                    <li><strong>Key Candlestick Patterns</strong> - The 5 that actually work</li>
                    <li><strong>Moving Averages</strong> - The only indicator you really need</li>
                    <li><strong>Trading Psychology</strong> - Mastering your emotions</li>
                    <li><strong>Trading Plan & Execution</strong> - Systematic profit-taking</li>
                </ol>

                <p>That's it. These 7 concepts, truly understood and applied, will outperform any complex system or
                    expensive course.</p>

            <!-- Types of Trading -->
            <section class="section">
                <h2>⏰ Choose Your Style: Trading vs Investing</h2>

                <p>Before going further, you need to decide what approach suits your personality and lifestyle:</p>

                <h3>Day Trading</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Buying and selling within the same day</li>
                    <li>Requires 2-4+ hours of screen time daily</li>
                    <li>Higher stress, faster profits (or losses)</li>
                    <li>Needs $25,000+ for US pattern day trading rules</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Swing Trading (Recommended for Most)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Holding positions for days to weeks</li>
                    <li>Requires 30-60 minutes daily</li>
                    <li>Balanced risk/reward profile</li>
                    <li>Works with any account size</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Position Trading / Investing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Holding for months to years</li>
                    <li>Requires a few hours weekly</li>
                    <li>Lower stress, benefits from compounding</li>
                    <li>Focuses more on fundamentals</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>💡 Recommendation</h4>
                    <p>This course focuses primarily on <strong>swing trading</strong> principles because they offer the
                        best risk/reward for most people. However, the concepts apply to all timeframes—the same
                        support/resistance level that matters on a 15-minute chart matters on a weekly chart.</p>
