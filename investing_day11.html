                <h2>🧠 Your Brain is Your Worst Enemy</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    "The investor's chief problem—and even his worst enemy—is likely to be himself."
                    <cite>— Benjamin Graham</cite>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Evolution designed your brain to avoid pain and seek instant gratification. In the stock market, these biological hard-wirings cause you to <strong>buy when things are expensive (greed)</strong> and <strong>sell when they are cheap (fear)</strong>.</p>

                <h2>🚫 The 4 Most Dangerous Biases</h2>

                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>1. Loss Aversion</h4>
                    <p>The pain of losing $100 is twice as strong as the joy of gaining $100. This causes investors to hold on to "losers" too long, hoping they'll break even, while selling "winners" too early to lock in small gains.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>2. Confirmation Bias</h4>
                    <p>We only seek out information that agrees with our current thesis. If you love a stock, you'll read bullish articles and ignore the bearish ones. <strong>Fix:</strong> Actively search for the smartest people who <i>disagree</i> with you.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>3. Recency Bias (FOMO)</h4>
                    <p>The tendency to believe what happened recently will continue to happen. "The market has been going up for 3 years, so it's safe to buy now!" This leads to buying at the top of bubbles.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>4. Hindsight Bias</h4>
                    <p>Thinking you knew an event would happen after it occurred. "I <i>knew</i> the market would crash!" No, you didn't. You're just rewriting your own history. (Recall the Decision Journal from Day 8).</p>

                <h2>🎭 Meeting Mr. Market</h2>
                <p>Benjamin Graham introduced the analogy of <strong>Mr. Market</strong>. Imagine you own half a business with a partner named Mr. Market. Every day, he offers to buy your half or sell you his. He is a manic-depressive.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some days he's ecstatic and offers a ridiculously high price.</li>
                    <li>Other days he's suicidal and offers a ridiculously low price.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="box-success">
                    <h4>🌟 The Rational Response</h4>
                    <p>Mr. Market is there to <strong>serve you, not lead you</strong>. If his price is high, sell to him. If it's low, buy from him. If he's just being noisy, ignore him. His erratic emotions don't change the underlying value of the business.</p>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>⚖️ Strategies for Rationality</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Check your portfolio less:</strong> Checking daily invites emotional tampering. Check monthly or quarterly instead.</li>
                    <li><strong>Automate Your Investing:</strong> Use Dollar-Cost Averaging. If you buy the same amount every month, you automatically buy more shares when they are cheap and fewer when they are expensive.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Sleep Test:</strong> If you can't sleep because a stock is down 10%, you either have too much money in it or you don't understand the business well enough.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="action-step">
                    <h4>📝 Action Step 1: Identify Your Bias (15 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Think about your most recent investment. Did any of the 4 biases above play a role? Were you following the crowd (Recency)? Were you only reading positive news (Confirmation)? Be honest.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="action-step">
                    <h4>📝 Action Step 2: The "Anti-Thesis" (20 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Pick one company you are bullish on. Find a well-researched article or video explaining why it's a <strong>sell</strong>. Read/watch it with an open mind. Does your conviction still hold? If not, why?</p>

                <h2>🔑 Key Takeaways</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>The stock market is a <strong>transfer of wealth</strong> from the impatient/emotional to the patient/rational.</li>
                    <li><strong>Confirmation bias</strong> is the silent killer of portfolios. Always seek disconfirming evidence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mr. Market</strong> is your servant, not your guide.</li>
                    <li>Use <strong>automated systems</strong> and written rules to protect yourself from your own impulses.</li>
