                <h2>🏆 Congratulations!</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; margin-bottom: 0;">You've completed the Stock Market Mastery 80/20 Course. You now possess the knowledge that most traders spend years acquiring. But remember: knowledge is potential—<strong>applied knowledge is power</strong>.</p>
            </div>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>📋 The 7 Pillars: Complete Summary</h2>
                <p>These are the 20% of concepts that create 80% of trading success. Master these deeply.</p>
                
                <div class="pillar-card">
                    <h4>Pillar 1: Market Structure & Price Action</h4>
                    <p>Read price movement directly. Identify uptrends (HH/HL), downtrends (LH/LL), and ranges. Trade with the trend, never against it. Break of Structure signals potential trend changes.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="pillar-card">
                    <h4>Pillar 2: Support & Resistance</h4>
                    <p>The foundation of all trading decisions. Know where to enter, exit, and place stops. Role reversal creates the highest probability trades. Trade bounces in ranges, breakouts in trends.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="pillar-card">
                    <h4>Pillar 3: Risk Management</h4>
                    <p>The #1 skill for survival. Never risk more than 1-2% per trade. Position Size = Risk ÷ (Entry - Stop). Only take 1:2 or better risk-reward setups. This is non-negotiable.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="pillar-card">
                    <h4>Pillar 4: Candlestick Patterns</h4>
                    <p>5 patterns that work: Pin Bar, Engulfing, Inside Bar, Doji, Morning/Evening Star. Context is everything—patterns only work at key levels with confirmation.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="pillar-card">
                    <h4>Pillar 5: Moving Averages</h4>
                    <p>The only indicator you need. 20/50/200 EMAs define trend direction and act as dynamic support/resistance. Trade pullbacks to MAs in trending markets.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="pillar-card">
                    <h4>Pillar 6: Trading Psychology</h4>
                    <p>80-90% of success is mental. Master the 5 emotional traps: Fear, Greed, FOMO, Revenge Trading, Overconfidence. Think in probabilities, focus on process over outcome.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="pillar-card">
                    <h4>Pillar 7: Trading Plan & Execution</h4>
                    <p>A written plan removes emotion. 7 components: Market, Style, Entry, Exit, Risk, Routine, Rules. Journal every trade. Review weekly. Improve 1% at a time.</p>

                            <p>Start with real money but tiny positions (0.5% risk). The goal is to experience real emotions with minimal financial impact. Continue journaling. Review weekly.</p>

                    <h4>💡 The 1,000 Trade Rule</h4>
                    <p>You cannot judge your trading system with fewer than 100 trades. You won't truly master it until 1,000+ trades. Stay patient. Stay consistent. The compound effect will reward you.</p>

                <h2>💭 Final Words from Your Mentor</h2>
                
                <blockquote>
                    "The market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient."
                    <cite>— Warren Buffett</cite>
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>You now have everything you need to become a profitable trader. But knowing and doing are different things. The next 90 days will test you. You'll want to skip steps. You'll get frustrated with paper trading. You'll be tempted to increase risk too quickly.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Resist.</strong></p>
                
                <p>The traders who succeed are not the smartest or the ones with the best strategies. They're the ones who show up every day, follow their rules, and improve incrementally. They're the ones who treat losses as tuition and keep learning.</p>
                
                <p>You've invested 14 hours into this course. Now invest the next year into mastering what you've learned. The compounding effect of daily improvement is extraordinary. In 5 years, you'll look back and be amazed at how far you've come.</p>

                    <h4>💡 The Truth About Trading Success</h4>
                    <p>Trading profitably is not about finding a secret strategy or holy grail indicator. It's about:
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>1.</strong> Having an edge (you now have one)<br>
                    <strong>2.</strong> Managing risk ruthlessly (the 1-2% rule)<br>
                    <strong>3.</strong> Executing consistently (your trading plan)<br>
                    <strong>4.</strong> Managing your psychology (process over outcome)<br>
                    <strong>5.</strong> Improving continuously (your trading journal)<br>
                    <br>
                    That's it. No secrets. Just discipline over time.</p>
