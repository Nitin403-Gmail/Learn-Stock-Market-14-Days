                <h2>📊 The Big Three: A Company's Report Card</h2>

                <p>Financial statements are the language of business. As an investor, you must learn to speak this language. They tell you a story about a company's health and performance. There are three key statements to understand.</p>

                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>💡 An Analogy</h4>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Income Statement:</strong> Like a video of the company's performance over a period (e.g., one year). It tells you if it was profitable.
                        <br><strong>Balance Sheet:</strong> A snapshot of the company's financial health at a single point in time. It shows what it owns and what it owes.
                        <br><strong>Cash Flow Statement:</strong> Tracks the actual cash moving in and out of the company. Cash is the lifeblood of a business.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>1. The Income Statement (Profit & Loss)</h2>
                <p><strong>Question it answers:</strong> "How profitable is the company?"</p>

                <h3>Key Items:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Revenue (or Sales):</strong> The total amount of money the company generated from selling its products or services. This is the "top line."</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):</strong> The direct costs of creating the products or services.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong> Revenue - COGS.</li>
                    <li><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong> Other costs to run the business (salaries, marketing, R&D).</li>
                    <li><strong>Operating Income:</strong> Gross Profit - Operating Expenses. Shows the profitability of the core business operations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Net Income (or Earnings/Profit):</strong> The famous "bottom line." This is the profit left over after all expenses, interest, and taxes have been paid.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>💡 What to Look For</h4>
                    <p>Is revenue consistently growing? Is the company profitable (positive net income)? Are its profit margins stable or increasing?</p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>2. The Balance Sheet</h2>
                <p><strong>Question it answers:</strong> "What is the company's financial position?"</p>
                <p>The balance sheet is based on a fundamental equation: <strong>Assets = Liabilities + Shareholder's Equity</strong></p>

                <h3>Key Items:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Assets:</strong> What the company owns (e.g., cash, inventory, property, equipment).</li>
                    <li><strong>Liabilities:</strong> What the company owes to others (e.g., debt, accounts payable).</li>
                    <li><strong>Shareholder's Equity:</strong> The net worth of the company. It's what would be left for shareholders if all assets were sold and all debts were paid.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>💡 What to Look For</h4>
                    <p>Does the company have more assets than liabilities? How much debt does it have? Is the shareholder's equity growing over time?</p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>3. The Cash Flow Statement</h2>
                <p><strong>Question it answers:</strong> "Where is the company's cash coming from and where is it going?"</p>
                <p>Profit is an opinion, but cash is a fact. A company can report a profit but still go bankrupt if it runs out of cash. This statement is crucial.</p>

                <h3>Three Sections:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cash Flow from Operations:</strong> Cash generated by the company's core business activities. This should almost always be a positive number for a healthy company.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cash Flow from Investing:</strong> Cash used for investments, such as buying new equipment or acquiring other companies. Often negative for growing companies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cash Flow from Financing:</strong> Cash from activities like issuing or buying back stock, taking on debt, or paying dividends.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>💡 What to Look For</h4>
                    <p>Is the company generating strong, positive cash flow from its operations? This is the most important sign of a healthy business.</p>
                </div>
            </section>
