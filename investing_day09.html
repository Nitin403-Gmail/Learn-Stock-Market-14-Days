                <h2>🥚 How Many Eggs in One Basket?</h2>
                <p>Diversification is the only "free lunch" in investing, but too much of it can lead to average (benchmark) returns. This is called "Diworseification."</p>
                
                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>💡 The Sweet Spot</h4>
                    <p>For most individual investors, owning <strong>15 to 25 stocks</strong> provides the best balance. It's enough to protect you if one company goes to zero, but few enough that your "winners" can still meaningfully drive your total returns.</p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>📊 Position Sizing: Do You Believe?</h2>
                <p>Not all stocks in your portfolio should be equal. You should weight them based on your conviction and the risk profile.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Core Positions (4-7% each):</strong> High-quality, stable companies with huge moats. These are your anchors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Support Positions (2-3% each):</strong> Growth stocks or cyclical companies that are slightly riskier but have higher potential.</li>
                    <li><strong>Speculative/Satellite (1% or less):</strong> High-risk, high-reward bets. Only a small fraction of your portfolio should be here.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>🏢 Sector Diversification</h2>
                <p>It's not enough to own 20 stocks if they are all in Tech. If the Nasdaq crashes, your whole portfolio will sink regardless of how many companies you own.</p>
                <div class="box-success">
                    <h4>✅ Aim for a Mix of Sectors:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Growth:</strong> Technology, Consumer Discretionary.</li>
                        <li><strong>Defensive:</strong> Consumer Staples, Healthcare, Utilities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cyclical:</strong> Financials, Industrials, Energy.</li>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>⚖️ Rebalancing: Buying Low, Selling High</h2>
                <p>Rebalancing is the process of bringing your portfolio back to your target weights. If a stock was 5% of your portfolio but grew to 15%, you might be "over-exposed."</p>
                <p><strong>Method:</strong> Once or twice a year, review your portfolio. Sell a little bit of your winners (which are now overpriced) and add to your laggards (which might now be bargains). This automatically forces you to "sell high and buy low."</p>

                    <h4>📝 Action Step 1: Sector Audit (15 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>If you have a current portfolio (or a watchlist), categorize each ticker by sector. Are you too heavy in one area? If so, identify a high-quality company in a different sector to research next.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="action-step">
                    <h4>📝 Action Step 2: Position Sizing Plan (15 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Decide on your "Maximum Position Size." For many, this is 10%. This means no single stock can ever represent more than 10% of your total wealth. Having a rule now prevents emotional decisions later.</p>

                <h2>🔑 Key Takeaways</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>15-25 stocks</strong> is often the ideal range for a focused individual portfolio.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weightings</strong> should reflect your conviction—don't treat every stock equally.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cross-sector diversification</strong> protects you from systemic industry crashes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rebalancing</strong> is a disciplined way to harvest profits and manage risk.</li>
