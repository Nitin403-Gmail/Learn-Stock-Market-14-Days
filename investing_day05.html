                <ol>
                    <li>Understand that "Price" and "Value" are two different things.</li>
                    <li>Master the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio and its limitations.</li>
                    <li>Learn about P/S, P/B, and PEG ratios for different types of companies.</li>

                <h2>💰 Price vs. Value</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    "Price is what you pay. Value is what you get."
                    <cite>— Warren Buffett</cite>
                </blockquote>
                <p>As a long-term investor, your goal is to buy businesses for less than they are worth. Valuation ratios help us determine if a stock is overvalued (expensive) or undervalued (a bargain).</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>📈 The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio</h2>
                <p>This is the most common valuation metric. It tells you how much the market is willing to pay for every dollar of the company's profit.</p>
                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>💡 Formula: Share Price / Earnings Per Share (EPS)</h4>
                    <p>If a stock is $100 and earns $5 per year, its P/E is 20. This means you are paying 20x the current earnings to own the company.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Interpreting P/E:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High P/E:</strong> Investors expect high growth in the future. (Common in Tech)</li>
                    <li><strong>Low P/E:</strong> Investors expect slow growth or see potential risks. (Common in Utilities or Banks)</li>
                    <li><strong>Trailing P/E:</strong> Based on the last 12 months of actual earnings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Forward P/E:</strong> Based on analysts' estimates of next year's earnings.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>🛠 Other Essential Tools</h2>
                
                <h3>1. Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio</h3>
                <p>Used for companies that aren't profitable yet (like high-growth startups). It compares price to the total revenue generated.</p>

                <h3>2. Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio</h3>
                <p>Compares market price to the company's net asset value. Crucial for banking and insurance companies.</p>

                <h3>3. PEG Ratio (Price/Earnings to Growth)</h3>
                <p>A higher P/E might be justified if the company is growing very fast. The PEG ratio divides the P/E by the growth rate. A PEG < 1.0 is often considered a great "growth at a reasonable price" (GARP) opportunity.</p>

                <h2>⚠️ Beware the Value Trap</h2>
                <p>A "Value Trap" is a stock that looks cheap (low P/E) but is actually a bad investment because the business is fundamentally declining.</p>

                    <h4>🚩 Red Flags of a Value Trap</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Declining revenue year over year.</li>
                        <li>High debt combined with a falling share price.</li>
                        <li>An industry being disrupted (e.g., Blockbuster when Netflix arrived).</li>

                    <h4>📝 Action Step 1: Sector Comparison (15 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Find the average P/E ratio for two different sectors (e.g., Software vs. Consumer Staples).</p>
                    <p>Why is the "expensive" software group potentially a better investment than the "cheap" staple group? (Hint: Think about growth rates).</p>

                <div class="action-step">
                    <h4>📝 Action Step 2: PEG Calculation (15 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Find a high-growth stock (like Nvidia or Amazon). Look up its Forward P/E and its projected earnings growth. Calculate the PEG. Does the growth justify the high price?</p>

                <h2>🔑 Key Takeaways</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>A low P/E doesn't always mean a stock is a bargain; a high P/E doesn't always mean it's expensive.</li>
                    <li>Valuation must be viewed in the context of <strong>growth</strong> and <strong>industry averages</strong>.</li>
                    <li>The <strong>PEG ratio</strong> is a powerful tool to balance price and growth.</li>
                    <li>Always ask: "Why is this stock cheap? Is the business broken or just out of favor?"</li>
