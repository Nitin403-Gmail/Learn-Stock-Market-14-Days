            <section class="section">
                <h2>📊 1. Dividend Growth Investing (DGI)</h2>
                <p>Focuses on companies that not only pay a dividend but <strong>increase it every single year</strong>. These are often "Dividend Aristocrats."</p>
                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>💡 Yield on Cost</h4>
                    <p>If you buy a stock at $100 paying a $3 dividend (3% yield), and they grow that dividend by 10% every year, in 10 years they will be paying $7.78. Your "yield on your original cost" is now 7.78%. In 20 years, it could be over 20%! This is how patient investors live off their portfolios.</p>
                </div>
                <p><strong>Ideal for:</strong> Those seeking passive income and stability.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>🚀 2. Growth Investing</h2>
                <p>Focuses on companies increasing their revenue and earnings at a faster rate than the average market. Dividends are rare because they reinvest all cash to grow faster.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Potential for "multi-bagger" returns (10x, 20x).</li>
                    <li><strong>Cons:</strong> High volatility and high valuation (expensive P/E). If the growth slows down, the price can crash 50% quickly.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Ideal for:</strong> Younger investors with long timelines and high risk tolerance.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>💎 3. Value & Quality Investing</h2>
                <p><strong>Deep Value:</strong> Looking for "ugly" stocks at extremely low valuations. Buying a dollar's worth of assets for 50 cents. (The Ben Graham style).</p>
                <p><strong>Quality (GARP):</strong> Growth At A Reasonable Price. Looking for wonderful businesses with high moats (Day 6) and high ROE (Day 4) and buying them when their price is "fair." (The Warren Buffett style).</p>
                <div class="box-gold">
                    <h4>🌟 Which is better?</h4>
                    <p>Statistically, high-quality compounders (Quality) tend to outperform over decades with less stress than "Deep Value" cigar butts.</p>
