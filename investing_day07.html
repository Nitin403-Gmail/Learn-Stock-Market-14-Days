                <h2>🏇 The Jockey and the Horse</h2>
                <p>In investing, the "Horse" is the business (the moat, the industry) and the "Jockey" is the management. A great horse can win even with a mediocre jockey, but a great jockey can turn a good horse into a champion.</p>
                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>💡 The Job of a CEO</h4>
                    <p>Most CEOs focus on operations (making more widgets). But the <i>best</i> CEOs also focus on <strong>Capital Allocation</strong>—deciding what to do with the profits the business generates.</p>

                <h2>💰 The 5 Choices of Capital Allocation</h2>
                <p>Management has exactly five options for every dollar of excess cash. Their choices reveal their competence:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Reinvest in the Core:</strong> Spend on R&D or expansion. This is the best use if returns are high.</li>
                    <li><strong>Acquire Other Businesses:</strong> Can be great, but often leads to overpaying. Look for a track record of smart acquisitions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pay Down Debt:</strong> Strengthens the balance sheet. Especially important if interest rates are high.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pay Dividends:</strong> Returning cash to shareholders. Shows the company is generating real cash.</li>
                    <li><strong>Buy Back Stock:</strong> Only a good idea if the stock is undervalued. It increases every remaining shareholder's piece of the pie.</li>
                </ol>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>🧬 Incentives & Skin in the Game</h2>
                <p>Charlie Munger famously said, "Show me the incentive and I'll show you the outcome."</p>
                
                <h3>Insider Ownership</h3>
                <p>Does the CEO own a lot of stock? If they own millions of dollars of their own stock, they are more likely to think like an owner (you!) rather than just an employee.</p>

                <h3>Compensation Structure</h3>
                <p>Are bonuses based on stock price (short-term) or on Return on Invested Capital (long-term)? We want leaders focused on long-term value creation.</p>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>📖 Evaluating Transparency</h2>
                <p>Don't just listen to the slick presentations. Read the <strong>Annual Letter to Shareholders</strong>.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Do they admit mistakes?</strong> A CEO who never admits a mistake is a red flag.</li>
                    <li><strong>Is it clear or filled with jargon?</strong> If they can't explain the business simply, they might be hiding something.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do they focus on long-term goals or quarterly earnings?</strong> Avoid those obsessed with beating "analyst expectations" every 90 days.</li>
                </ul>
