# Learn Cursor AI: A Practitioner’s Guide

*A structured, mental-model-first approach to mastering AI-native coding.*

## Course Overview

This guide is designed for the practitioner–thinker. We move beyond "magic tricks" to understanding the *mechanics* of AI-assisted engineering.

### 📚 Curriculum Roadmap

| Module | Title | Focus | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | **[The Mental Model](01_Mental_Model.md)** | **Architecture & Philosophy** | Understand *how* Cursor "sees" code vs. typical editors. |
| **02** | **[The Tactical Suite](02_Tactical_Suite.md)** | **Tab, Cmd+K, & Chat** | Master the edit-compile-debug loop 10x faster. |
| **03** | **[Context Engineering](03_Context_Engineering.md)** | **@Symbols & Indexing** | Learn to feed the AI the *right* data for precise answers. |
| **04** | **[Agentic Workflows](04_Agentic_Composer.md)** | **Composer & Multi-file** | Build entire features across multiple files in natural language. |
| **05** | **[Production Hygiene](05_Production_Hygiene.md)** | **Docs & Refactoring** | Use AI to document, test, and harden code (not just write it). |
