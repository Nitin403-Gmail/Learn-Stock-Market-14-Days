                <h2>🌍 Understanding Market Nature</h2>
                <p>Most beginners think the market is random chaos. It is not. The market is a mechanism for price
                    discovery, and it moves in cycles. Understanding these cycles is like having a map in a dense
                    forest.</p>
                <p>If you buy when the market is preparing to drop (Distribution), you will lose. If you sell when the
                    market is preparing to rise (Accumulation), you will lose. Today, we learn to read the map.</p>

                <h2>🔄 The 4 Phases of the Market</h2>
                <p>Every stock, index, or crypto moves through these four phases repeatedly on all timeframes (1-minute,
                    15-minute, Daily, Weekly).</p>

                            <h4>Accumulation Phase (The Base)</h4>
                            <p>This happens after a downtrend. Prices flatten out. Smart money (Institutions) starts
                                buying quietly. The chart looks like it's moving sideways.</p>

                            <h4>Advancement Phase (The Uptrend)</h4>
                            <p>Price breaks out of the Accumulation zone. This is where we want to be buying. The trend
                                is clearly Up. Higher Highs and Higher Lows.</p>

                            <p>After a good run, the trend stalls. Smart money starts selling their shares to late
                                retail buyers. Price moves sideways again but looks "heavy".</p>

                                profit from the drop.</p>

                    <h3>💡 Mentor's Tip</h3>
                    <p>As an intraday trader, you mostly want to trade during Phase 2 (Trending Up) and Phase 4
                        (Trending Down). Phase 1 and 3 are choppy and can hit your stop-losses frequently unless you are
                        very experienced.</p>

                <h2>📚 Essential Market Vocabulary</h2>
                <p>To operate professionally, you must know the professional terms.</p>

                    <div class="term-card">
                        <h4>Liquidity</h4>
                        <p>How easily you can buy or sell shares without impacting the price. High liquidity = Easy to
                            enter/exit (e.g., Reliance, HDFC Bank). Low liquidity = Dangerous (Penny stocks).</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="term-card">
                        <h4>Volatility</h4>
                        <p>The range of price movement. High volatility means big swings (good for profit, high risk).
                            Low volatility means small moves (safer, less profit).</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="term-card">
                        <h4>Gap Up / Gap Down</h4>
                        <p>When the market opens significantly higher or lower than yesterday's close due to overnight
                            news. This creates a "Gap" on the chart.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="term-card">
                        <h4>Short Selling</h4>
                        <p>Selling a stock you don't own (borrowing from broker) with the intent to buy it back lower.
                            This allows you to profit when markets fall.</p>

                <h2>🕵️♂️ Smart Money vs. Retail Money</h2>
                <p>This is the most important concept for your survival.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Smart Money:</strong> Banks, FIIs (Foreign Institutional Investors), DIIs (Domestic
                        Institutional Investors). They have billions. They move the market.</li>
                    <li><strong>Retail Money:</strong> You, me, and the public. We are small fish. We cannot move the
                        market.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The Strategy:</strong> We never fight Smart Money. We identify their footprints (volume, big
                    candles) and we follow them like a remora fish follows a shark. If they buy, we buy. If they sell,
                    we sell.</p>

                    <li>Open TradingView and load a chart for <strong>Nifty 50</strong>.</li>

                    <li>Notice how price never moves in a straight line; it moves in waves.</li>
