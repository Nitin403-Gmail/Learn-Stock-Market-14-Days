                <h2>🧠 Trading is 80% Psychology</h2>
                <p>You can have the best strategy in the world (like the ones we learned in Days 8-10), but if you
                    cannot control your emotions, you will lose. The market is designed to trigger your deepest fears
                    and desires.</p>

                <h2>👹 The 3 Demons of Trading</h2>

                <div class="emotion-grid">
                    <div class="emotion-card fear">
                        <div class="emotion-title">😨 FEAR</div>
                        <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Exiting a winning trade too early because you are scared profits
                            will vanish. Or refusing to enter a perfect setup because you are scared to lose.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cure:</strong> Trust your Backtesting. Trust your Stop Loss. Accepting the risk
                            <em>before</em> entering eliminates fear.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="emotion-card greed">
                        <div class="emotion-title">🤑 GREED</div>
                        <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Holding a trade passed your target hoping for "more". Adding to a
                            losing position hoping it will come back.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cure:</strong> Have a fixed Target. Once hit, book it (or at least book 80%). Nobody
                            went broke booking profits.</p>
                    </div>

                        <div class="emotion-title">🏃 FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out)</div>
                        <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Seeing a big green candle and jumping in blindly because "everyone
                            is making money". This usually happens right at the top.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cure:</strong> <span style="color:var(--text-light);">"There is always another
                                bus."</span> The market will be here tomorrow. Missing a trade is better than losing
                            money on a bad trade.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>The "No-Touch" Drill:</strong> For your next trade, set your SL and Target in the system
                        (Bracket Order). Then... take your hands off the mouse. Do not touch it until one side is hit.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Journal Your Emotions:</strong> Start writing down how you felt <em>during</em> the
                        trade. Were you anxious? Excited? Bored? (Bored is good).</li>
