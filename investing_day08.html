                <h2>🏗 The Investment Thesis</h2>
                <p>An investment thesis is a short paragraph (or a few bullet points) explaining <strong>why</strong> you are buying a stock and what you expect to happen over the next 3-5 years.</p>
                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>💡 If You Can't Write It Down, You Don't Own It</h4>
                    <p>Writing forces clarity. If you can't explain why a stock is a good investment in 100 words or less, your understanding is too fuzzy. This document will be your anchor when the market gets volatile.</p>

                <h2>📝 A Standard Research Framework</h2>
                <p>Use this 5-step checklist to evaluate any new stock idea:</p>

                <h3>1. Business Profile</h3>
                <p>What do they do? How do they make money? (Recall Day 2: The Business Model).</p>

                <h3>2. The Moat Analysis</h3>
                <p>What protects them? Is it Brand? Switching Costs? Network Effects? (Recall Day 6).</p>

                <h3>3. Financial Health</h3>
                <p>Check the ROE, Margins, and Debt levels. Are the numbers improving? (Recall Days 3 & 4).</p>

                <h3>4. Valuation</h3>
                <p>Is the Current P/E or PEG reasonable compared to historical averages? (Recall Day 5).</p>

                <h3>5. Management & Incentives</h3>
                <p>Does the CEO have skin in the game? Are they good capital allocators? (Recall Day 7).</p>

                <h2>💀 The Pre-Mortem: Thinking About Failure</h2>
                <p>Most investors only focus on the "upside." Pros focus on the "downside."</p>
                <div class="box-warning">
                    <h4>🛠 Perform a Pre-Mortem</h4>
                    <p>Imagine it's three years from now and the investment has been a total disaster. You've lost 50% of your money. <strong>What happened?</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Did a new competitor emerge?</li>
                        <li>Did the industry face new regulations?</li>
                        <li>Did management make a terrible acquisition?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Identifying these risks now helps you monitor them objectively in the future.</p>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>📓 The Decision Journal</h2>
                <p>Every time you buy (or sell) a stock, record:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Date and Price.</li>
                    <li>The Investment Thesis.</li>
                    <li>Your current emotional state (Are you excited? Nervous?).</li>
                    <li>Key metrics you will watch (e.g., "Revenue must grow at 10%").</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This prevents "Hindsight Bias"—the tendency to think you knew something all along when you actually didn't.</p>

                    <li>Always identify the <strong>failure points</strong> (Pre-Mortem) before you put your money at risk.</li>
                    <li>Your best defense against market volatility is <strong>deep conviction</strong> built through your own research.</li>
